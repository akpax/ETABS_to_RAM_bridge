# ETABs_to_RAM_bridge

## Project Summary
This application is a GUI wrapper between ETABS and RAM Concept.  It automats the typically time consuming task of transfering column forces from ETABS into RAM Concept.  It allows the user to specify which ETABS load case, load type, and level and the Ram Concept load layer.  Additionally, it provides prompting  and validation during API initialization. 







## Using the Software

In the assets section, select the LSW_HoldownReport_windows.exe file for download and place it in your desired directory. (This will also be the directory where the output folder is created.)
